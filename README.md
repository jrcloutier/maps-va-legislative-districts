# Virginia Legislative Districts

This repo contains shapefiles for Virginia's current state House and Senate legislative districts. The folder contains separate maps for House and Senate districts, as well as 16 custom regional maps that group districts by one of eight regions: Capital, Chesapeake, Hampton Roads, Northern Virginia, Piedmont, South Side, Southwest, and Valley. Some regional maps overlap. Large districts --- particularly those representing rural, sparsely populated areas --- may extend into multiple regions.

Each map is saved in GeoJSON format and no bigger than 2MB. 

The original shapefiles for the 2021 court-approved House, Senate, and Congressional districts were obtained from the Virginia Redistricting Commission [website](https://www.virginiaredistricting.org), then geoprocessed using QGIS. Whereas the commission's maps do not account for waterways (the Chesapeake Bay, James River,  York River, Rappahannock River, etc.), these custom maps better reflect Virginia's boundaries.
